# Emma & Matts Vector Pipeline

## Introduction

This is a scrappy pipeline for downloading and aligning publicly available
paired-end runs for a given target organism.


## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/emmacollins01/WGS.git

cd ./WGS
bash Install.sh

conda activate fastq2matrix

# Then in install fastq2matrix pipeline

git clone https://github.com/pathogenseq/fastq2matrix.git
cd fastq2matrix
python setup.py install



```

##Â Running

Ensure the conda fastq2matrix environment is active

```
conda activate fastq2matrix
```

Next navigate inside the WGS directory and create a text ile containing the
run accession numbers of interest, like in the example samples.txt file. This
will be used to run the pipeline.

Example Command

```
python Real_Time_Running.py --ID Test --SamplesFile Samples.txt --ReferenceFile PlasmoDB-46_Pfalciparum3D7_Genome.fasta --DownloadThreads 4 --AnalysisThreads 20
```

## Parameter Breakdown

* **ID** = The ID associated with this given analysis run.
* **SamplesFile** = Path to a plain text file containing the run accession IDs of interest.
* **ReferenceFile** = Path to reference file to use in alignment.
* **DownloadThreads** = Number of processes assigned to download the runs of interest.
* **AnalysisThreads** = Number of processes assigned to analyse the runs of interest.
